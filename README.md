# EngineTest
Testing a multiplatform game engine written in C/C++
I plan to get this engine to a point where I am comfortable with C/C++ and have it running on my desired platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux). After I get there, I intend to take what I've learned and apply it to a more documented, better optimized version of this which will also be open-source. EngineTest is a temporary project but when I'm finished I may revisit it to fix bugs and it will stay open source.
